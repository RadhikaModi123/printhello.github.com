title:  Potential Features
---

Julia is still a very young programming language, and there are many features that have been discussed and planned to various extents, but not yet implemented.
This page documents some of these potential future features, but is likely to be out of date. See the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/julia-dev) and [GitHub issues](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues) for the latest discussion on potential features.
